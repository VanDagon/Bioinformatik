The .jar of the Smith Waterman algorithm is designed to be run with 
at least two arguments (in this order):
1. The filepath of the strings to be aligned
2. The filepath of the scoring matrix
3. Custom deletion cost value (optional)

The algorithm will find the best local alignment of the two strings.
